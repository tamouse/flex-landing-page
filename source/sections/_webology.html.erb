      "What is a <em>Webologist</em>??"
      <br />
      I hear you ask...

    <p class="text-center lead">
      A <strong>Webologist</strong> is a term I invented for myself as
      someone who studies the
      <em>culture</em>,
      <em>people</em>,
      <em>technology</em>,
      and
      <em>impacts</em>
      of the World-Wide Web and the Internet.

    <p class="text-center ">
        I am a practitioner of software development, including building
        web applications using Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, and many other
        languages, libraries, and frameworks.
    </p>

    <p class="text-center ">
        I am also a disciple of software as a craft (aka SWaaC), learning
        and teaching skills in crafting software systems that work for the
        people intended. I teach, coach, mentor, and encourage others to
        discover this fun and exciting field.
